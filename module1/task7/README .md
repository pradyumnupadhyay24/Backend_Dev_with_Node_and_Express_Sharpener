`1` Like the youtuber return a response like "Welcome to my  Node Js project". Just follow the way he writes code in 30th video.
`2`  Based on the url the user hits , I want you to return  custom responses.
- When url = /home , return response ==> Welcome home
- When url = /about, return response ==> Welcome to -   About Us page
- When url =/node, return response ==> Welcome to my Node Js project
